### ✅ Complete SMC Concepts Implemented

1. **✓ Order Blocks** - Institutional accumulation/distribution zones
2. **✓ Breaker Blocks** - Failed support/resistance turned reversal zones (NEWLY ENHANCED)
3. **✓ Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)** - Price imbalances created by smart money
4. **✓ Market Structure** - Higher Highs/Lows, Lower Highs/Lows tracking
5. **✓ Liquidity Sweeps** - Stop hunts before reversals
6. **✓ Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)** - 50-70% retracement zones
7. **✓ Multi-Layer Confirmation** - Traditional + ICT dual validation

## 🔥 BREAKER BLOCK MODEL (NEWLY ENHANCED)

### What are Breaker Blocks?

Breaker blocks are **former support or resistance levels** that:
1. Get broken through by price
2. Then get **retested from the opposite side**
3. Act as strong reversal zones for institutional traders

### Bullish Breaker Block Entry
```
Price Pattern:
1. Bullish Order Block forms
2. Price breaks BELOW the order block
3. Price returns and breaks ABOVE the order block
4. Entry: On retest of broken level
5. Stop Loss: Below the breaker block low
```

### Bearish Breaker Block Entry
```
Price Pattern:
1. Bearish Order Block forms
2. Price breaks ABOVE the order block
3. Price returns and breaks BELOW the order block
4. Entry: On retest of broken level
5. Stop Loss: Above the breaker block high
```

### Why Breaker Blocks Work
- **Institutions use them** for position reversal
- **Failed support becomes resistance** (and vice versa)
- **Liquidity trapped** on wrong side of market
- **High win rate** when combined with market structure
