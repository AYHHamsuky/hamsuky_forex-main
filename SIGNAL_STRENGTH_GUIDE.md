## ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing Thresholds

### Adjust in `main.py` Line ~1186

```python
# Current setting
MIN_SIGNAL_STRENGTH = 60  

# More conservative (fewer signals)
MIN_SIGNAL_STRENGTH = 70

# More aggressive (more signals)
MIN_SIGNAL_STRENGTH = 50
```

### Impact of Changes

```
Threshold 70: ~30% fewer signals, ~10% higher win rate
Threshold 60: Balanced (recommended)
Threshold 50: ~40% more signals, ~8% lower win rate
```

---

## üìà Tracking Signal Performance

### Monitor These Metrics

1. **Win Rate by Strength Band**
   - Track 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90-100 separately
   
2. **Average R:R by Strength**
   - Higher strength should = higher R:R achieved

3. **Signal Frequency**
   - Ensure quality over quantity

4. **Market-Specific Performance**
   - BTC, Gold, Forex may perform differently

---

## üö® Warning Signs

### When to Adjust

‚ö†Ô∏è **Lower Threshold (to 50)** if:
- Not enough trade opportunities
- Missing obvious moves
- Win rate on 60-69 signals > 70%

‚ö†Ô∏è **Raise Threshold (to 70)** if:
- Too many losing trades
- Win rate on 60-69 signals < 55%
- Account in drawdown

‚ö†Ô∏è **System Issue** if:
- No 70+ signals for 24+ hours
- All signals clustered at 60-65
- Win rate below 50% on 80+ signals

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to trade 2 great signals than 10 mediocre ones
2. **Patience Pays**: Wait for 70+ strength signals during high volatility
3. **Track Everything**: Keep a journal of signal strength vs. outcome
4. **Market Dependent**: Some markets naturally produce higher/lower strength signals
5. **Time of Day**: Kill zones (London/NY open) often produce stronger signals

---

**Remember**: The signal strength system is designed to keep you out of bad trades more than get you into good ones!
